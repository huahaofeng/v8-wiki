This page lists the latest test results for different builds.

The statistics are presented in the following format
- Test stats are listed as +passed/-failed (e.g., `+1000/-2`)
- Run-rate is the percentage of total tests run (including both passed and failed tests), less than 100% run-rate means that some tests are skipped by the test driver (e.g., runs too long, or known failures that are being investigated). Skipped tests can be found in `<test-suite>.status` files.

# Simulated v8-riscv testing

The following stats are obtained from CI test runs and can be reproduced as
```
tools/run-tests.py --outdir=<your-simulated-build-dir> <test-suites>
```


| Test Suite | Test Status (run-rate)| Notes |
| - | - | - |
| cctest | +6515/-0 (99%) | all pass |
| unittests | +3282/-0 (99%) | all pass |
| mjsunit | +4882/-0(96%) | ~20 additional failures for riscv64 are currently skipped (issues opened)|
| wasm-spec-tests, wasm-js | disabled | after pulling the latest from the latest V8 repo, more tests are failing, not yet investigated  |
| wasm-api-tests | +17/-0 (100%) | all passed |
| fuzzer, mkgrokdump | | did not pick up any tests, similar to ARM64 (see #6)|
| intl | +218/-0 (96%) | same run rate as ARM64 |
| message | +296/-0 (48%) | same run-rate as ARM64 |
| inspector | +253/-0 (48%) | same run-rate as ARM64 |
| debugger | +308/-0 (97%) | same run-rate as ARM64 |

To run one or more test suites listed below, specify your own simulated build directory, e.g.,
```
tools/run-tests.py --outdir=out.gn/riscv.gcc.simulated.debug/ <test suite>
```

**TODO**
- Add performance benchmark success rate
- Add release build stats
- Add stress-test stats
