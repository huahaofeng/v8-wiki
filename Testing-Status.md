This page lists the latest test results for different builds. The statistics are presented in the following format
- Test stats are listed as +passed/-failed (e.g., `+1000/-2`)
- Run-rate is the percentage of total tests run (including both passed and failed tests), less than 100% run-rate means that some tests are skipped by the test driver (e.g., runs too long, or known failures that are being investigated). Skipped tests can be found in `<test-suite>.status` files.

Note that `fuzzer` and `mkgrokdump` suites are excluded because they do not run any tests (similar to other targets).

# Running on x86 via simulated v8-riscv build

The simulated build is built w/ x86 as host architecture and riscv64 as target architecture so that the v8 binary is in x86 but the code generated by v8 is riscv-64 binary and run in a riscv64 simulator embedded in V8.
