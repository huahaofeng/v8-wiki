This page lists the latest test results for different builds. The statistics are presented in the following format
- Test stats are listed as +passed/-failed (e.g., `+1000/-2`)
- Run-rate is the percentage of total tests run (including both passed and failed tests), less than 100% run-rate means that some tests are skipped by the test driver (e.g., runs too long, or known failures that are being investigated). Skipped tests can be found in `<test-suite>.status` files.

Note that `fuzzer` and `mkgrokdump` suites are excluded because they do not run any tests (similar to other targets).

# Running on x86 via simulated v8-riscv build

The simulated build is built w/ x86 as host architecture and riscv64 as target architecture so that the v8 binary is in x86 but the code generated by v8 is riscv-64 binary and run in a riscv64 simulator embedded in V8.

## Debug build w/ default options

The following stats are obtained from CI test runs and can be reproduced as
```
tools/run-tests.py --outdir=<your-simulated-build-dir> <test-suites>
```

| Test Suite | Test Status (run-rate)| Notes |
| - | - | - |
| cctest | +6515/-0 (99%) | all passed |
| unittests | +3282/-0 (99%) | all passed |
| mjsunit | +4882/-0(96%) | ~20 additional failures for riscv64 are currently skipped (issues opened)|
| wasm-spec-tests, wasm-js | to-be-added |  |
| wasm-api-tests | +17/-0 (100%) | all passed |
| intl | +218/-0 (96%) | same run rate as ARM64 |
| message | +296/-0 (48%) | same run-rate as ARM64 |
| inspector | +253/-0 (48%) | same run-rate as ARM64 |
| debugger | +308/-0 (97%) | same run-rate as ARM64 |

To run one or more test suites listed below, specify your own simulated build directory, e.g.,
```
tools/run-tests.py --outdir=out.gn/riscv.gcc.simulated.debug/ <test suite>
```

## Debug build w/ stress options

The following stats are obtained from CI test runs and can be reproduced as
```
tools/run-tests.py --variants=stress --outdir=<your-simulated-debug-build-dir> <test-suites>
```

| Test Suite | Test Status (run-rate)| Notes |
| - | - | - |
| cctest | +6489/-0 (98%) | |
| unittests | +0/-0 (100%) | No tests run with stress option enabled |
| mjsunit | +4819/-33(95%) | ~30 additional failure compared to non stress build (issues opened see [#56](https://github.com/v8-riscv/v8/issues/56) and [#84](https://github.com/v8-riscv/v8/issues/84)) |
| wasm-spec-tests, wasm-js | to be added|  |
| wasm-api-tests | +0/-0 (100%) | No tests run with stress option enabled |
| intl | +218/-0 (96%) | same run rate as ARM64|
| message | +296/-0 (48%) |same run rate as ARM64 |
| inspector | +253/-0 (48%) | same run rate as ARM64|
| debugger | +304/-4 (97%) | 4 additional failures compared to non-stress build (see [#56](https://github.com/v8-riscv/v8/issues/56))|

## Release build testing w/ default options

## Release build w/ the stress options

The following stats are obtained from CI test runs and can be reproduced as
