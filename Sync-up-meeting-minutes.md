Information sharing:
- Our talk proposal was accepted to RISC-V Global Forum (September)
- Got feedback towards v8 upstreaming: our simulated build testing results are quite promising, suggest to do additional stress-test on compiler and optimization, release-build tests, and run the performance suite  

Action items:
- Define milestones for early September (Peng)
- CI efficiency issues not fully resolved, need help from anyone w/ experience of setting up CI (?)
- Address permissions of adding labels or re-assign issues (Brice)
- Wei's team present cross-compiled build status next time (Wei)
- Resolve how to setup wiki repo that is most convenient to us (Ye, Brice, Peng)
