Welcome to the v8-riscv wiki!

This is an on-going project to develop the RISC-V backend for the V8 JavaScript Engine. After a few months of intensive development, we have built a sufficient MVP (Minimal Viable Product) for the RISC-V64-bit  port, which currently passes over 90% (10,000+) standard V8 test cases using v8-riscv64 simulated build. We have also established a sustainable porting methodology and development best practices that we feel confident invite a broader community participation. We welcome you joining our development effort. Plenty of supports are still needed for a complete and high-performing V8 on RISC-V.

This repo will be the community home for some time before the code-base is upstream to the V8 community. For general V8 information, see [V8 Dev](https://v8.dev/). The rest of the wiki is specific to the RISC-V V8 backend.
