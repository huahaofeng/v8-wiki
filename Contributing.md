As we hope to eventually get this code upstreamed, we will generally follow all policies from the [official v8 project](https://v8.dev/docs/contribute).

## Issues

If you would like to work on an existing issue, first check if anyone is already assigned and if so, discuss with that person before beginning work. If you would like to work on a new problem or enhancement, first create an issue for it and discuss with the community. The best way to do this will be to [join us in Slack](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=8o_uD7KjGECcdTodVZH-3OiciJKG_BJHrqMNgnsFFqtUNlRUNEQ5QUgxNk0wVEVaTjJBTDNOMDNIQS4u).
