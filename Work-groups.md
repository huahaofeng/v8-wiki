While the initial RISC-V port has established a functioning baseline and a viable porting structure, there is still a long way before we deliver a high-performing V8 that supports a variety of RISC-V hardware and with a wide range of ISA extensions. The following list defines areas of work that need to be done.

# Immediate needs

## Testing

## Native build

## Tools

# Important but not urgent

## RISCV32 support

## Node bring up

## Performance

## Other ISA extensions
